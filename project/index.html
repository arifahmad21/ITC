          <p>While Lamborghini’s lineup of 21st century road cars is more outlandish than ever, nothing earns street cred more than how track-worthy a model is. Enter the Essenza SCV12, Lambo’s postmodern hat tip to track specials of yore like the Diablo GTR and Miura Jota.

          Freed from the constraints of road legality, the Essenza uncorks Lamborghini’s naughtiest impulses from bow to stern. Extreme bodywork yields over 2,600 pounds of downforce, more than a GT3 race car and, liberated from emissions equipment, the hulking 6.5-liter, 819 hp engine is Lambo’s most powerful V-12 yet. Then there’s the futurist cockpit, which features a button-and-dial-clad steering yoke that wouldn’t be out of place in a Formula 1 car. And although the 40 buyers of the $2.6 million Essenza won’t have their own competition series, Lamborghini promises Essenza-only track days that should satisfy the owners’ race cravings. B.W.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="f-box1">
          <p>Landmark cars often hail from unexpected places, but the Rimac Nevera has dealt earth-shattering blows to the supercar microcosm. For starters, the battery-powered Nevera obliterated internal combustion records by routing 1,914 hp to all four wheels, eclipsing zero-to-60 mph times of everything from McLarens to Koenigseggs. More shockingly, the EV hypercar is the brainchild of 33-year old Croatian wunderkind Mate Rimac, who founded the firm in 2011.

          The Rimac Nevera’s early impact arose from its sensational performance stats, but the legacy of this hypercar will transcend a mere model. In summer 2021, the Croatian startup purchased a majority stake in Bugatti, marking the first (and likely not the last) time a legacy supercar brand falls under the control of an EV upstart.

        </div>
        <div class="f-box1">
          <p>So equipped, this Mustang GT should have laid down some impressive test numbers. Should have. At the track, a 3,500-rpm clutch dump launched it to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds as it galloped on through the quarter mile in 12.5 seconds at 114.7 mph. Both results rival earlier V-8 manual Mustang models; a 2021 Mach 1 manual hit 60 mph in 4.2 seconds and the quarter mile in 12.6 seconds at 113.1 mph, while a 2019 Bullitt needed 4.6 seconds to reach 60 mph and 12.9 seconds for the quarter at 112.5 mph. A 2018 GT Performance posted 4.3 seconds to 60 mph and a 12.6-second, 113.5-mph quarter mile.

          When it came to slowing the pony down, those big Brembos delivered. Standing on the middle pedal stopped the Mustang from 60 mph in just 99 feet, a feat that varied by only 2 feet over five attempts. </p>

          <p>If the 707-hp Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat is the ultimate expression of the traditional muscle car, then the SRT Demon is something from another planet entirely.

          Many automakers have built track-focused cars for driving on road courses, but Dodge is the first to apply the same level of rigor to a vehicle built for the muscle car’s natural environment: The drag strip. The Demon will run the quarter mile in 9.65 seconds at 140 mph. On the way, it will do 0 to 60 mph in 2.3 seconds — and pull a wheelie.</p>

          <p>The Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R (1999 - 2002). Fifth and last of the Skyline GT-Rs (the R35 dropped the ‘Skyline’ part of the name), poster-child for a generation weaned on the likes of Gran Turismo, Fast & Furious and a host of other digital dreams. An angry-looking four-seat coupe so full of Japanese technical brilliance that back in the day it could carve out a laptime that belied its apparent lack of power.

          A lack addressed post-haste by a myriad of tuners who  - primed by the ’32 and ’33 - knew that the basic GT-R package was fertile soil for boost and trickery. And over the years, as with every generation of GT-R, there have been some monster meddled-with specials - 400bhp with a vague re-map, 5-600 with some relatively minor internals, 800 -1000bhp if you go the whole hog and start forging things and walloping about with monster single blowers</p>

          <p>It’s simply the most powerful series-production road car ever built. It packs an astonishing 2,011 hp and 1,256 ft lbs of torque. That’s enough to catapult this hip-high projectile from zero to 62 mph in less than three seconds and whisk it from zero to 186 mph in just 9.1. Top speed? That’s limited to 217mph.

          This is the all-electric Lotus Evija from the fabled British sports-car maker founded by the visionary Colin Chapman back in 1952. The new Evija—it supposedly means “the living one”—is all carbon-fiber monocoque, Le Mans–inspired aerodynamics and a state-of-the-art electric power train developed by the technical wizards at Williams Advanced Engineering. 

          Only 130 examples of the Evija will be built, with first deliveries in early 2023. As for the price, expect to pay around $2.3 million. H.W.</p>
